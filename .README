## React + Three.js Data Flow

- **index.html** → provides `<div id="root">` (mount point)
- **main.jsx** → renders `<App />` into `#root`
- **App.jsx** → holds state + handlers; passes props to children
- **Controls.jsx** → inputs only; registers what the user clicks and tells App what's going on
- **ThreeScene.jsx** → reads props and renders 3D with Three.js

**Flow:** Controls → App (state change) → ThreeScene (visual update)
