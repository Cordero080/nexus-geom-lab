## How to Get Started

### Option A: Start Now (Recommended)

1. Open `docs/study-plan/README.md`
2. Open `docs/study-plan/00-INDEX.md`
3. Follow Priority 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 in order

### Option B: Quick Reference Only

1. Open `docs/study-plan/05-REFERENCE.md`
2. Use decision tree to find what you need
3. Reference `docs/hooks-customHooks/*` docs as needed

## What Makes This Different

Most documentation explains HOW to use something. This curriculum explains:

- **WHAT** your app does
- **WHY** each file exists
- **WHERE** data flows
- **HOW** everything connects
- **WHEN** to use each file

---

## Quick Facts

- **Total Files:** 7 study documents + 3 reference docs
- **Total Time:** ~10 hours to complete
- **Difficulty:** Beginner → Intermediate
- **Prerequisites:** None (you'll learn React/Node.js concepts)
- **10 Core Files:** Already identified for you

---

## Reference Materials Always Available

When you get stuck or need to look something up:

```
docs/hooks-customHooks/
├── UNDERSTANDING_DATA_FLOW.md    ← "Where does this data come from?"
├── HOOKS_INVENTORY.md             ← "What does this hook do? (quick)"
└── CUSTOM_HOOKS_GUIDE.md          ← "How do I use this hook? (detailed)"
```

---

## After You Complete the Study Plan

You'll be able to:

- ✅ Modify existing features confidently
- ✅ Add new features without breaking things
- ✅ Debug issues by understanding the system
- ✅ Read new code quickly
- ✅ Help others understand your codebase
- ✅ Refactor without fear
