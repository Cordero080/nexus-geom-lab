## ⏱️ Time Commitment

### Full-Time Study (Fastest)

```
Day 1: Priority 1 (3 hours) → Foundation
Day 2: Priority 2 (2 hours) → Authentication
Day 3: Priority 3 (2.5 hours) → 3D Rendering
Day 4: Priority 4 (2 hours) → Save/Load
─────────────────────────────
Total: ~9.5 hours over 4 days
```

### Part-Time Study (Recommended for Work)

```
1-2 hours per day × 10 days = Complete understanding
Spread across 2 weeks
```

### Self-Paced Study (Flexible)

```
Study whenever you have time
No deadlines
Each priority self-contained
```

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of all 4 priorities, you'll understand:

### Architecture

- Frontend: React + Three.js (3D graphics)
- Backend: Node.js + MongoDB
- Communication: REST API + JWT

### Data Flow

- How props flow through components
- How state updates propagate
- How API requests work

### Complete User Journey

1. User signs up → Authentication
2. User interacts with 3D scene → Rendering
3. User saves creation → Persistence
4. User browses gallery → Loading

### Code Patterns

- Parameter destructuring
- Context for global state
- useRef for persistent objects
- useEffect for side effects
- Hook coordination patterns
